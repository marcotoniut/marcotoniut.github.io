## 🧾 Generating the CV PDF

The `/cv` page is designed to generate a printable, styled PDF version of the CV using **Puppeteer**.

### 1. Install Chrome for Puppeteer (if not already available)

```bash
npx puppeteer browsers install chrome
```

### 2. Run the CV print script

```bash
pnpm print-cv
```

This script will:

- Start a local development server on port `3001`
- Open the `/cv` page in Puppeteer
- Export it as a PDF located at:

`./local/Marco Toniut (CV).pdf`

If you encounter an error about missing Chrome, re-run the install command above.

---

## 🌍 Deployment

Build and deploy the website to GitHub Pages:

```bash
pnpm deploy
```

The deployment script will:

- Clear any build caches
- Run a fresh production build
- Push the compiled output to the `gh-pages` branch
- Disable Jekyll with a `.nojekyll` marker

## 🔤 Translations

The site uses [`typesafe-i18n`](https://github.com/ivanhofer/typesafe-i18n) for multilingual support.

### To regenerate translation files:

```bash
pnpm typesafe-i18n
```

### To watch and rebuild translations automatically during development:
